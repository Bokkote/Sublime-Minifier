# A Javascript and CSS Minifier for Sublime Text 2

The plugin supports the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) and [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) compilers for Javascript minification and [Reducisaurus](http://code.google.com/p/reducisaurus/) for CSS minification.

Default key binding: 
`ctrl + alt + m` - attempts to minify the current buffer and replaces the buffers content
`ctrl + alt + shift + m` - attempts to minify the current buffer and saves the output to a separate file.

This module was forked from [JsMinifier](https://github.com/cgutierrez/JsMinifier).
